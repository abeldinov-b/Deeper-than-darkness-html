                <p>Before you stands a dark cave entrance, like a wound in the earth. The light from your flashlight doesn't penetrate. The forest lies behind you, and ahead lies silence and uncertainty. One step, and there may be no turning back.</p>

                <p>The flashlight beam illuminates the stone walls and a human skull on the floor. Writing appears on the wall:
                    "Deeper than darkness."
                    The darkness recedes further into the cave. It becomes clear: this place won't let you go.</p>

            <h3>Lore Discription</h3>
            <p>This is an atmospheric psychological horror in which fear is born not from screamers, but from the depths, silence and the feeling that there may be no way out.

                The player finds himself in a huge system of underground caves. Light is limited, the map is unreliable, and the geometry of space itself is changing, making one doubt the reality of what is happening. There are almost no enemies here, but the feeling that you are being watched does not leave for a second.
                
                The game is full of isolation, suspense, and the realization that you've gone too deep. The creature in the caves is rarely seen directly, but its presence is constantly felt in the sounds, shadows, and changes in the environment.
                
                 This is not a game about monsters.
                This is a game about the fear of losing control.</p>
